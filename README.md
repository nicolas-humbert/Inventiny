# Inventiny
A tiny inventory management system project with .NET6 & Blazor. \
Will not be continued further as it was only a one day project for training purposes.

## Usage 
Basic .NET usage, nothing more, nothing less.

### Memory
Only deals with in-memory data management but can easily transition to any db with EF Core implemetation, only needs to implement IInventoryRepository main interface.

### Errors
Will handle basic form errors based on Inventory model.\
Basically you cannot add or edit inventory with already exisiting name.\
I might have left some edge cases though.

## Future
Nothing will be done on this project past the end of August 2023 but you can use code and try to understand what has been done.
